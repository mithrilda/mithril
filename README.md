What is Mithril?
----------------

Mithril is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Mithril uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Mithril is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.
